    story: 'Maya, an engineer, notices her peer constantly missing deadlines, slowing the team. Instead of venting or complaining to the manager, she says, "Hey, do you have a minute? I noticed the last few handoffs came in late, and it\'s been hard to keep things on track. Can I share a few thoughts?" The peer thanks her for being direct. They discuss causes and agree on a new check-in schedule. Maya kept it brief, focused on impact, and didn\'t assume intent.'
